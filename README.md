# Hersh's Vim Configuratin
I use Vim for writing code and note taking. If you clone this repository into your `~/.vim/`, you should immediately have access to my setup.

### Vim-Pandoc Implementation for Notes
I use vim-pandoc so that I can create documents using pandoc markdown, and then using a single editor shortcut (`:Render`) render the markdown file as a PDF via a LaTeX engine. This saves time, and allows for specification of TeX parameters like margins, template, etc. Also inline formulas work great.
